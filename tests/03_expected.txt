You are standing at the Entrance.
There is nothing to do here.

You move to the north, arriving at the Garden.

You are standing at the Garden.
A voluminous tome trembles violently in its bookshelf, threatening to bring the whole thing down on itself.

>>> 
You reach out and stroke along the spine of the Trembling Tome. You hear the sound of ruffling pages, and the shuddering stops, allowing you to check out the book with no problems.

You are standing at the Garden.
All is calm in this room. A battered, but well-stocked bookshelf keeps things together along the western wall.

>>> 
You move to the east, arriving at the Parlour.

You are standing at the Parlour.
An old, battered shield rests against the wall here.

>>> 
The shield shines and shimmers like a mirror made of steel. You decide to take it with you.

>>>
You move to the south, arriving at the Workshop.

+--------------------+
You are standing at the Workshop.
A beautiful silver sword has been wedged deep into a stone pedestal here.

>>> 
You heave against the stone and pull the sword free from its grasp. You hear the sharp hum of the blade as it moves through the air - a job well-accomplished.

>>> 
Check what? 
You are an adventurer, with a SKILL of 5 and a WILL of 5.
You are carrying:

Trembling Tome
Shining Shield
Singing Sword

With your items, you have a SKILL level of 26 and a WILL power of 0.

>>> 
Bye!
