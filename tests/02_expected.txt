You are standing at the Entrance.
There is nothing to do here.

You move to the north, arriving at the Garden.

You are standing at the Garden.
A voluminous tome trembles violently in its bookshelf, threatening to bring the whole thing down on itself.

>>> 
You reach out and stroke along the spine of the Trembling Tome. You hear the sound of ruffling pages, and the shuddering stops, allowing you to check out the book with no problems.

You are standing at the Garden.
All is calm in this room. A battered, but well-stocked bookshelf keeps things together along the western wall.

>>> 
You move to the east, ariving at the Parlour.

You are standing at the Parlour.
An old, battered shield rests against the wall here.

>>> 
You shine and buff the shield as much as you can, but you cannot seem to return it to its former glory.

>>>
You move to the south, arriving at the Workshop.

+--------------------+
You are standing at the Workshop.
A beautiful silver sword has been wedged deep into a stone pedestal here.

>>> 
You struggle to pull the sword from the stone, but despite your best efforts, it doesn't budge.

>>> 
Bye!
