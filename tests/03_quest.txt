Singing Sword | PULL SWORD | PULL the sword from the stone. | A beautiful silver sword has been wedged deep into a stone pedestal here. | A stone pedestal lies in the centre of the room, devoid of swords. | SKILL 14 | You struggle to pull the sword from the stone, but despite your best efforts, it doesn't budge. | You heave against the stone and pull the sword free from its grasp. You hear the sharp hum of the blade as it moves through the air - a job well-accomplished. | Workshop

Shimmering Shield | SHINE SHIELD | SHINE an old shield until it shimmers. | An old, battered shield rests against the wall here. | There is nothing of note here. | SKILL 8 | You shine and buff the shield as much as you can, but you cannot seem to return it to its former glory. | The shield shines and shimmers like a mirror made of steel. You decide to take it with you. | Parlour

Trembling Tome | CALM TOME | CALM a trembling tome in the workshop. | A voluminous tome trembles violently in its bookshelf, threatening to bring the whole thing down on itself. | All is calm in this room. A battered, but well-stocked bookshelf keeps things together along the western wall. | WILL 5 | You reach forth to try calming the book, but the bookshelf just trembles harder! Did that book just snap at you with... teeth? | You reach out and stroke along the spine of the Trembling Tome. You hear the sound of ruffling pages, and the shuddering stops, allowing you to check out the book with no problems. | Garden
